# Open-Skies

Welcome! Outlier: Open Skies has been relicensed under MIT in order to maximize the utility people will get from the
source code. The short version: You can do pretty much whatever you want with this code!

In short, Outlier is a 3D space combat and trading simulator with an X3 style dynamic universe and economy with a
Freelancer style open world and an inertial flight model (face in a different direction than you fly and only
thrust to change direction / velocity).

The full license is below, however read this first (you'll regret not reading these).

1. You should seriously read the controls in src/resource/Controls.txt
2. The skybox textures are 7zipped. You need to decompress them before you can test the game. assets/Textures/Skybox
contains the archive.
3. When you map your joystick, map throttle to a hat. You don't want to thrust constantly! This isn't Freelancer,
you will run out of fuel fast if you don't use controlled bursts of thrust to manauver.
4. Outlier represents a potentially massive start towards your own space combat and trading simulator! I encourage
you to ask me questions and let me know what you come up with!

Also, this game contains additional open source components

Now here is the license!

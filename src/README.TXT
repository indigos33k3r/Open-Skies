Best played with a traditional 3 axis joystick.

Note that this is Alpha 1 and the game is incomplete.
Many features and assets are missing, and this is
only the first of many alpha and later beta releases
before a final version is reached.

This game is designed to be easy to mod, try it!

Have fun!

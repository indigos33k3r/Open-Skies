I strongly advise you read Controls.txt before playing.
Best played with a traditional 3 axis joystick.

Note that this is Alpha 3 and the game is incomplete.
Many features and assets are missing, and this is
only one of many alpha and later beta releases
before a final version is reached.

You can edit your controls in ~/.outlier/payload.txt !
See the included Controls.txt for details.

This game is designed to be easy to mod, try it!

Have fun!

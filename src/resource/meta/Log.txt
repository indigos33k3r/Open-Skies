I ran lots of automated refactoring and code analysis to get this project up to
a more modern standard of Java code. I haven't gone to enhanced for loops yet
because I am unsure whether I want to give up ready access to the index which I
often print when debugging.

I also fixed some bugs.

Bugs Fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* fixed issue where a docked ship could keep thrusting after being docked
  - docking ports now set the thrust of the ships docked at them to 0
* fixed issue where an old .outlier file could have an out of date payload, 
  leading to failure to apply mappings
  - deletes old file, deploys new one
  - also has the effect of automatically "repairing" damaged settings

Meta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wrote the JME team about my project, I wanted to tell them that their engine
is awesome and show them the work I've done so far. I wouldn't be nearly this
far along if it weren't for them.

Also, on the MIT license, I want to say that I really hope someone makes a game
based on the work done in Outlier. I know if I found this project when I was in
high school back in the day, I would be elated. Back then I was just hacking in
VegaStrike and GL-117 (and modding Freelancer).

And the 100th episode of MLP: FiM was disappointing. They could have done a lot
better than regurgitating bad fan fics. They had a chance to give personality
and believable character traits / back stories to all the background ponies, and
they totally blew it off.

2015-06-13 "Hello Log!"
################################################################################
I have decided to keep an in-project log of thoughts and problems so that I can
check it into source control.

I have created 2 new branches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Development - Intended to store my working revisions (not guaranteed to even
compile, it's what I personally will be working out of). I will merge it into
master when I do a release.
* Alpha3-2 - A snapshot for Alpha 3.2 . Every release from this point on will
get its own branch to act as a snapshot.

What's next?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two tasks are obviously the next steps:

* Immediately, I want to do some bug hunting.
* Then, I want to add an in-game way of configuring controls.

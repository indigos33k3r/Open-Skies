################################################################################
I have decided to keep an in-project log of thoughts and problems so that I can
check it into source control.

I have created 2 new branches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Development - Intended to store my working revisions (not guaranteed to even
compile, it's what I personally will be working out of). I will merge it into
master when I do a release.
* Alpha3-2 - A snapshot for Alpha 3.2 . Every release from this point on will
get its own branch to act as a snapshot.

What's next?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two tasks are obviously the next steps:

* Immediately, I want to do some bug hunting.
* Then, I want to add an in-game way of configuring controls.
